# Tank-Heating-System
In this code the behavior of Model Predictive Control can be examined. Based on the control Horizon and Plant Model the optimizer gives out a set of in put controls which will give out corresponding Outputs. Note that this code only shows the behavior of the system in just one time step.
The next milestone of this project will be to demonstrate how the MPC takes control actions over a period of time to bring the temperature to the set point as fast as possible along with respecting the constraints.
